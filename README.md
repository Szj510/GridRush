## 🧩 Mini-Games

The game features **13** distinct skill-based mini-games. Each online battle randomly samples 9 of them:

| #   | Name                | Description                                                             |
| --- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Math Rush**       | Solve arithmetic problems before time runs out.                         |
| 2   | **Power Mash**      | Mash the button to fill the energy bar.                                 |
| 3   | **Stroop Test**     | Click the _color_ of the text, not the word.                            |
| 4   | **Reaction**        | Wait for green, then click instantly.                                   |
| 5   | **Matrix**          | Memorize a flash sequence, then reproduce it.                           |
| 6   | **Lock Pick**       | Tap when the spinner lands in the green zone.                           |
| 7   | **Scramble**        | Type a code on a constantly shuffling keypad.                           |
| 8   | **Aim Lab**         | Hit shrinking targets before they disappear.                            |
| 9   | **1-2-3 Sequence**  | Click numbers in ascending order.                                       |
| 10  | **Don't Touch Red** | Navigate your cursor through a maze, avoiding red zones.                |
| 11  | **Gravity Maze**    | Flip gravity to guide a block through spike-filled passages.            |
| 12  | **Rhythm Copy**     | Watch a 3-instrument beat pattern, then replay it with S / D / F.       |
| 13  | **Odd One Out**     | Spot the single different character hidden in a grid of identical ones. |

## 🔒 Security Design

GridRush runs entirely in the browser with no backend. All game state lives on the **host's** machine; the guest only sends action messages. All peer data and stored values are treated as untrusted:

| Layer                         | Measure                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P2P messages (host-side)**  | Every `NetworkMessage` is reconstructed by `services/sanitize.ts` — type-checked against an allow-list, numeric values range-clamped.           |
| **P2P messages (guest-side)** | `STATE_UPDATE` from the host is shape-validated (status allow-list, cell-count bound, required objects present) before being applied.           |
| **Skill picks**               | Guest-sent skill IDs are filtered to a fixed allow-list (`STEAL`, `FREEZE`, `DUEL`).                                                            |
| **Action rate-limiting**      | `RateLimiter` (token-bucket) enforces per-action limits: `HEARTBEAT` ≤ 3/s, `CLICK_CELL` ≤ 10/s, `INTERACTION` ≤ 20/s, `COMPLETE_GAME` ≤ 2/2 s. |
| **Room code injection**       | `joinGame` validates input against `/^\d{4}$/` before passing it to PeerJS.                                                                     |
| **BroadcastChannel events**   | Cross-tab lobby messages are validated by `sanitizeLobbyMessage` (type allow-list + regex-checked code).                                        |
| **localStorage poisoning**    | `sanitizeSettings` / `sanitizeStats` rebuild objects field-by-field rather than spreading parsed JSON directly.                                 |
| **Content Security Policy**   | A CSP `<meta>` tag restricts script sources, locks WebSocket/XHR to `*.peerjs.com`, and blocks `frame-src` / `object-src`.                      |

> **Inherent limitation**: Without a trusted server, a cheating _host_ can fabricate `STATE_UPDATE` messages. These measures protect against a cheating _guest_ and against local data corruption.
